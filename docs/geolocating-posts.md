# Geolocating posts

When editing a post, JEO will add an extra panel to the sidebar: **Geolocation**. Clicking on **Geolocate this post**, a popup will then be displayed.

New points can be added to the post by clicking on **Add new point** button. You can search for a specific location in the search bar.

It's also possible to choose the relevance of each point, which is useful when you have more than one point.

Map with geolocated posts contain markers on the localization of each post. Clicking on them will open a popup with its title and publication date. Clicking on the title will take you to the post itself.
