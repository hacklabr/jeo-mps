Any content that is added to that page will be ignored and the page will only display the Discovery feature.

## Stories

Stories are the geolocated posts that are shown on the map. Clicking on `SHOW FILTERS` allows you to filter these stories by date and tags. Below these filters, a list with the result will be shown. Each result is also a link to the story itself. Also, hovering the mouse on a map marker will highlight the related story int the left sidebar. In the same way, hovering the mouse on `View in map` text will highlight the map marker realted to it.

## Map Layers

In Map Layers tab you can search for maps and apply its layers to your interactive map. You can filter maps by name and select different layers from different maps. After selecting at least one layer from a map, you can click on `Clear` to remove all the selected layers from this map before applying the changes. It is also possible to add all layers from a map with one single click when selecting **Apply** next to a map result.

At the top of the sidebar, you will be able to see all the selected layers, allowing you to remove some of them. These layers always have a drag and drop function, so that you can re-order them. After reviewing these layers, you need to click on `Apply changes` to show them on discovery map.
